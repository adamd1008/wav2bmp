# wav2bmp

A simple Python 3 library for converting a WAV file into a BMP (and back!).

## Install prerequisites

1. Download the latest version of Python 3 from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the necessary Python 3 libraries

From the command-line:

```
python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose imageio
```

Note: you may need to use the command `python3` in place of `python`, depending on your platform. If in doubt, use command `python --version`.

3. Clone this respository

From the command-line:

```
git clone https://github.com/adamd1008/wav2bmp.git
```

4. (Optional) Install an image editor

This is up to you, if you want to perform resynthesis (i.e. BMP -> WAV). I use GIMP in my example below.

## Quick start: my first resynthesis!

Navigate to the `wav2bmp` directory in a command-line terminal. In this example I am using the Command Prompt on Windows. Adjust paths where appropriate, according to where you cloned this repository.

```
C:\Users\Adam>cd /d D:\Work\wav2bmp
